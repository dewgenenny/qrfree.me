Welcome to the repository of QRFree.me, where QR codes come to life without emptying your pockets. Because, let's be honest, who wants to pay to generate those funky little square things?

## What's This?

QRFree.me is a free, user-friendly QR code generator. It's designed for anyone who's ever thought, "I need a QR code, but why are these websites asking for my first-born child in return?" ðŸ¤”

Create QR codes for:
- URLs (because links are so 1999)
- Emails (make it easier for people to spam you)
- Text (turn your favorite joke into a QR code)
- ... and more!

## Features

- **User-Friendly**: So simple, even your grandma can use it. Hi, grandma! ðŸ‘‹
- **Mobile Optimized**: Works on devices of all shapes and sizes. Even that brick of a phone from 2001.
- **Multiple Formats**: Download in PNG, JPG, and GIF. Because choices are nice.
